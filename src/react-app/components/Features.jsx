            Pixel Based - No Injection
            All of our Bots are pixel based, meaning they do not inject into the game client. 
            This makes them harder to detect. 
            Heuristics based detection is the only way to detect them, and we have mitigations in place to reduce the risk of detection.

            Anti-Ban Randomization
            Each user has a unique signature, making it harder for heuristics to detect our bots.
            
            Auto Install
            Our bots are designed to be easy to install and use.

            Auto Update
            Our bots automatically update to the latest version, ensuring you always have the latest features and fixes.

            Fully Customizable
            Our bots are fully customizable, allowing you to tailor them to your specific needs and preferences.
